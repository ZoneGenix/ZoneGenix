    <td>Minecraft Seed Island</td>
    <td>-573947210</td>
    <td>Buried treasure and hidden loot make this seed immediately exciting. With several islands available to explore, you have the opportunity to collect a number of cool items, including 2 enchanted tunics, 6 gold nuggets, 8 gold ingots, an iron sword, and a lot more.
With 2 shipwrecks (the second offers the most rewards), you’ll have plenty of loot to search for. Look at the buried treasure map so you know how to get back to where you spawned.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Temple of Doom</td>
    <td>2029492581</td>
    <td>Welcome to the jungle! You'll be spawned right near a temple in a convenient place where you can cross over to a desert or a jungle biome - the choice is yours. You'll need to explore thoroughly for items, and beware of the pillagers that take over this area.
Arm yourself early on and you should be all set to experience an awesome survival game. Also, don't forget to check out the river, ocean, and mountains for additional items.

  <tr>
    <td>A Song of Ice and Spire</td>
    <td>2223210</td>
    <td>This icy seed offers a unique adventure and a bit of a challenge, too. Your character will spawn on the edge of a forest. From there, head toward the frozen river where you will start to see ice spikes coming up from the ground.
You may also see some polar bears and rabbits roaming around, but don't worry, they're harmless. Gather some resources and begin building in this chilly and intriguing seed.
